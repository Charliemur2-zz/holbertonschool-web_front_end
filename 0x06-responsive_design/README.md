# 0x06. Responsive design

Responsive web design
Web Stack programming

Overview
Before talking about media-queries, the backbone of responsive web design. Some basic elements are crucial and actually already implemented in our code. But itâ€™s important to know about these in case you want to add responsive web design to an existing website.

Viewport
The viewport is a meta seen in our first HTML advanced module. The width=device-width forces mobile browsers to adopt their real viewport width.

Code example

```
<head>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
</head>
```

Box-sizing
Code example

```
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
